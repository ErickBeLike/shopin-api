## E-commerce Project (API-First)

This is the API project for an e-commerce platform, built with an **API-First** approach using **Spring Boot**. The goal is to create a robust and scalable API that will serve as the backbone for a complete online store application, demonstrating skills in back-end development, business logic, and security.

The front-end of this project will be developed separately and will consume this API.
